                something and then leaves without a word. You want to be gentle, kind and reassuring. But, you don't

                <h3>Moral Consolation</h3>
                <p class="text-color">One of the better ways to help the poor and needy people is to give them a hand up
                    rather than a hand
                    out. Giving them moral support, showing heartfelt humility and respect makes them aware that someone
                    really does care about them and trying to improve their condition.</p>

                appliances,
                furniture and other materials. Rummage through your belongings and give them away to the needy. Delving
                through old stuff and donating does help the poor people and makes a difference to those who needs such
                stuff. Donating clothes especially in winter season when the weather is too cold is of great help to the
